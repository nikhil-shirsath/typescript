typescript is a open source pure object orianted programming language .

it is a strongly typed language .
it uses oops consepts . its superset of javascript .
It compiles to plain javscript .
typescript is ES6versions of javascript and some additional features.

TSC : typescript Compiler : this compiles typescript to javascript because all browsers understands javascript. 

It can't run directly on the web browsers thats why it have tsc .

after compilation ts file generates javascript file and the javascript file runs on the web browsers.

History : in 2010 Anders Hejlsberg (creator).

usage if typescript :
1. It supports OOPs .
2.it supports static typing , strongly typed . Modules ,Optional parameters.
3. Its fast , simple and most importantly easy to learn .
4.Compile time error catching 
5. supports all libraries of javascript.

why typescript is developed 
javascript was develop for client side scripting but developer also want to use javscript to used on the server side . that features also develop but the code became too heavey to write and run also that why we need typescript. which can also run on the serverside.

Features of typescript 
======================
TRANS-PILED
-----------
> typescript code is converted into plain javascript code 

> Typescript can be used anywhere : anybrowser , anydevice
>Typescript supports JS libraries 

Advantage of typescript 
======================
> Typescript always highlights errors at the compile time during the time of development , wheres javascript points errors at the runtime.
> typescript supports storngly typed or static typing , wheres this is not in javascript.
>great tooling supports with intellisense which provides active hints as the code added .
>It has a  namespace consept by  defining a module.


Disadvantage
===========

Typescript takes a long time to compile the code .
typescript does not support abstract classes.
if we run typescript appliction in the browser , a compilation step is required to transform typescript to javascript.
